General utilities

This prelude file proposes standard library features that _may_
belong in the _language_ (compiler-internal) prelude sometime, after
some further experience and discussion.  Until then, they live here.

[[value.nyi]]
== nyi

[source.no-repl,motoko]
----
func nyi() : None
----

Not yet implemented

Mark incomplete code with the `nyi` and `xxx` functions.

Each have calls are well-typed in all typing contexts, which
trap in all execution contexts.

[[value.xxx]]
== xxx

[source.no-repl,motoko]
----
func xxx() : None
----



[[value.unreachable]]
== unreachable

[source.no-repl,motoko]
----
func unreachable() : None

Calls are well-typed in all typing contexts, and they
trap in all execution contexts.
